## First Launch - Security Notice

**âš  Important: On first launch, macOS will show a security warning because this is a beta/development
release that uses ad-hoc code signing.**

If you see: "Apple could not verify "ox-db" is free of malware..."

Don't click "Move to Trash" - Follow these steps instead:

### Method 1: System Settings (Recommended)

1. Click "Cancel" or "Done" in the warning dialog
2. Go to System Settings (or System Preferences on older macOS)
3. Navigate to Privacy & Security
4. Scroll down to find: "ox-db" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer
5. Click "Open Anyway"
6. Click "Open" when prompted again

### Method 2: Right-click to Open

1. Go to your Applications folder
2. Right-click on ox-db.app
3. Select "Open" from the menu
4. Click "Open" in the warning dialog

This is a one-time setup. After approving the app once, it will launch normally.
